Project: Calculator Application Using Java Programming <br>
Objective : <br>
The objective of this project is to develop a simple yet effective Java-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Activities : <br>
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implements fundamental mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Input Handling: Accepts user input for numbers and operations, processes the inputs, and provides the correct result. <br>
Error Handling: Manages common errors like division by zero or invalid input formats to ensure smooth operation.
Technologies Used : <br>
Java (JDK 22.0.2): The primary programming language used to develop the calculator. <br>
Java I/O: Employed to handle user input and output using the command-line interface. <br>
Notepad: Used as a text editor to write the Java code. <br>
Command Prompt (cmd): Utilized to compile and run the Java program for user interaction with the calculator application. <br>
Key Insights : <br>
User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes a command-line interface for intuitive user interaction, allowing users to input values and choose operations. <br>
Modular Design: Applies object-oriented programming principles to organize the calculator's functionality into easily manageable and reusable methods for each operation. <br>
Error Handling Mechanism: Provides robust error handling to prevent crashes during operations like division by zero or incorrect inputs, ensuring reliable performance. <br>
Efficient Processing: Implements basic mathematical functions efficiently, allowing for quick and accurate calculations. <br>
Conclusion : <br>
The calculator project successfully demonstrates Java's object-oriented design principles and handling of user inputs. It offers essential arithmetic operations and error management, laying the groundwork for expanding to more complex mathematical functionalities in the future.
